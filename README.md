# DBSCAN
Implementation of classical DBSCAN using an R\*-Tree for structuring the data.

This implementation was done during an assignment at the Corporate State University Stuttgart. The goal of the assignment was to investigate parallelization approaches for DBSCAN. Therefore there are some branches investigating different parallel approaches.
